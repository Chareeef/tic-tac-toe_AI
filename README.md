# Tic-Tac-Toe with AI (Minimax Algorithm)

## Introduction

This project is a Python implementation of the classic game of Tic-Tac-Toe, developed as part of the "Python and Artificial Intelligence" bootcamp at Devtown. The project includes a multiplayer mode and a challenging mode against an AI opponent, which utilizes the powerful minimax algorithm.

## Features

- **Multiplayer Mode**: Play against your friends or fellow bootcampers in a fun and engaging multiplayer mode. Challenge each other and test your strategic skills.

- **AI Opponent**: Experience the thrill of battling against an AI opponent that utilizes the minimax algorithm. The AI evaluates possible moves, predicts future outcomes, and makes strategic decisions to maximize its chances of winning.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Terminal or Command Prompt

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/Chareeef/tic-tac-toe_AI.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```
   cd tic-tac-toe_AI
   ```

3. Run the game:

   ```
   python main.py
   ```

4. Follow the on-screen instructions to play either the multiplayer mode or the mode against the AI.

## How to Play

- Each player takes turns marking an empty space on a 3x3 grid.
- The objective is to be the first player to form a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line with their respective markers.
- If the grid is filled without a winner, the game ends in a draw.

## Acknowledgements

I would like to express my gratitude to the instructors and fellow bootcampers at Devtown for their guidance and support throughout the project. Their insights and collaboration were invaluable in the successful completion of this project.
